# Custom Schemas

These schemas do not exist as OpenApi schemas on Amazon Ads API documentation site. They were manually generated via
the markdown documentation provided on the Amazon Ads API site.

When Amazon provides the official OpenApi schemas on their site we will deprecate these from our repo. Until that time
these will have to be manually updated with any new schema changes by Amazon.
